# DESCRIPTION

The Chrome Extension for Personal Productivity Tracker is a browser-based tool developed with a React frontend, designed to help users set daily goals, monitor time spent on specific websites, and visualize productivity trends over time. Built as a Chrome extension, it leverages React’s component-based architecture to provide an intuitive and interactive user interface directly within the browser. Users can input daily productivity goals, view tracked time across different sites, and analyze their browsing patterns through charts and summaries.

React handles the frontend logic and dynamic rendering of components like timers, goal checklists, and graphical visualizations. It communicates with background scripts and content scripts via Chrome's messaging system. The extension utilizes Chrome’s native browser APIs, such as `chrome.tabs` and `chrome.history`, to monitor user activity, detect which websites are visited, and track how long the user stays on each domain. This data is stored locally using the `chrome.storage` API and periodically updated to reflect real-time usage.

The productivity tracker visually represents this data using React-compatible chart libraries (e.g., Chart.js or Recharts), enabling users to quickly assess how their time is being allocated and whether they are meeting their daily targets. It also provides reminders or alerts when excessive time is spent on unproductive sites, helping users stay focused.

This project effectively combines React’s frontend capabilities with Chrome extension APIs to deliver a real-time, interactive productivity tool. It highlights skills in modern web development, browser API integration, and user-focused application design, making it a powerful portfolio project for developers interested in building cross-functional browser tools with real-world utility.
